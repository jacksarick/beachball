Like pastebin, but expiries are based on visits. Say you set expiry to one hour, if no one visits it within an hour, then it goes away. But every time someone visits it, that hour gets renewed. Perfect for all those times a sensitive chunk of text needs to get passed around, but it's hard to co-ordinate exact times.
